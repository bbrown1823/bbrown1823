Walkthrough of Virtual Network setup along with osTicket


-This is my project on how i used osTicket to create my github profile for potential employeers. In this project I will show how I setup and used osTicket to manage user accounts. I was able to create users and put them in different departments where they demonstrated access to separate levels to information based on a company needs.

-Microsoft Azure was used to create a virtual environment in order to show the different ways someone can use osTicket to assign, escalate tickets to the right department in order to fix the issues that arrise in a timely manner.

-In this project you will see how to setup the prerequisites needed to successfully operate osTicket and how to install all the needed softward.
  
-Along with the prerequisites you will see some of the features you can use while managing the ticketing software.

-Ending with a view into the backend of the ticketing software where you can see admins and employees communicating to solve a problem to completion.
